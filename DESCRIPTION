Description: Functions to read, correct and analyse Rapid-A-Ci curve from Licor 
    photosynthesis systems. The aim of the script is to automate the 
    correction phase either for one or many RACi curves. The empty chamber file used to 
    correct a RACiR file is automatically chosen according to the match timestamp 
    (closest to the RACiR curve being corrected). The correction factor is derived from 
    the 1st to 5th polynomial as suggested by Stinziano et al. (2017).
