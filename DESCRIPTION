Description: Functions to read, correct and analyse Rapid-A-Ci curve from Licor 
    photosynthesis systems. The aim of the script is to automatize the 
    correction phase either for one or many RACi curves. Empty chamber file is 
    automatically chosen according to the match timestamp to ensure the 
    correction of the corresponding measurement files. Correction can be apply 
    from 1st to 5th polynomial as suggested by Stinziano et al. (2017)
